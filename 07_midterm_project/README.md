## Description of the Problem

This project is designed to predict employee attrition (i.e., whether an employee will leave the company) using various machine learning models. The data includes a variety of employee attributes, such as job role, work-life balance, age, education level, and many others. We will use this data to develop and evaluate different machine learning models, including decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost, to identify the factors contributing to employee attrition.

(The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. You can download it from the following link:
   [Employee Attrition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stealthtechnologies/employee-attrition-dataset))

### Key Goals:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify key features.
- Prepare the data for training by encoding categorical variables and splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
- Build and evaluate several machine learning models, comparing their performance using metrics like AUC, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Tune the models to achieve the best performance using techniques like hyperparameter optimization.
